# DisHook
A small, lightweight discord web-hook API wrapper. Made with Python.

### Stuff to do and to warn potential users about.

#### - Gotta fix timestamps btw.
#### - Add more validations checks for URLs.
#### - It's currently ASYNC, this will be an option in the final version. I.e. from DisHook.Async import App or from DisHook.Sync import App
